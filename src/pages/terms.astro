        <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the services provided by AVID TECH USA ("we", "our", or "us"),
          you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms,
          please do not use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>
          AVID TECH USA provides web design, development, and related digital services. The
          specific scope, deliverables, timeline, and pricing for each project will be outlined
          in a separate project proposal or agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Terms</h2>
        <h3>Proposals and Agreements</h3>
        <p>
          All projects require a signed proposal or agreement before work begins. The proposal
          will include project scope, timeline, pricing, and payment terms.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>
          Payment terms are specified in each project proposal. Typically, we require a 50%
          deposit before beginning work, with the remaining balance due upon project completion.
          Late payments may result in project delays or additional fees.
        </p>

        <h3>Revisions</h3>
        <p>
          Each project includes a specified number of revision rounds as outlined in the proposal.
          Additional revisions beyond the included rounds may incur additional charges.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
        <p>
          We commit to delivering projects within the agreed timeline. However, delays caused by
          late content delivery, feedback delays, or scope changes from the client may extend
          the timeline accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <h3>Client Materials</h3>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of all materials you provide (content, images, logos). You
          represent that you have the right to use these materials.
        </p>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p>
          Upon full payment, you own the final deliverables (website code, designs) created
          specifically for your project. We retain the right to showcase the work in our
          portfolio unless otherwise agreed.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Party Assets</h3>
        <p>
          Some projects may include licensed third-party assets (fonts, stock images, plugins).
          These remain subject to their respective licenses.
        </p>

        <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate and timely content, feedback, and approvals</li>
          <li>Designate a single point of contact for project communication</li>
          <li>Review and test deliverables before final approval</li>
          <li>Make timely payments according to the agreed terms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Warranties and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          We warrant that our work will be performed professionally and meet the specifications
          outlined in the project agreement. We do not guarantee specific business results
          (traffic, sales, rankings) from our work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our liability is limited to the amount paid for the specific service in question.
          We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate a project with written notice. If you terminate, you are
          responsible for payment for work completed up to the termination date. If we terminate
          for reasons other than your breach, we will refund any unused deposit.
        </p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          We treat all client information as confidential and will not disclose it to third
          parties without your consent, except as required by law or as necessary to perform
          our services.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of our services
          after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, United States. Any
          disputes will be resolved in the courts of Georgia.
        </p>
