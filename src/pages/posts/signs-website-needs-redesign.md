## Is Your Website Holding Your Business Back?

Your website might look "fine" to you, but is it actually working? Many business owners don't realize their website is actively losing them customers until they see the signs.

Here are five clear indicators that your website needs a redesign—and what you can do about each one.

## Sign #1: Your Website Looks Outdated

Web design trends change. A website that looked modern in 2018 now looks dated in 2025. Here's what "outdated" actually looks like:

### Visual Red Flags

- **Tiny text** that's hard to read on modern screens
- **Flash elements** or animations that don't work on phones
- **Stock photos** that scream "generic corporate"
- **Cluttered layouts** with too much happening at once
- **Gradients and shadows** from the early 2010s
- **No white space**—everything crammed together

### Why It Matters

First impressions happen in seconds. A Stanford study found that 75% of users judge a company's credibility based on website design alone.

If your site looks old, visitors assume your business is outdated too—even if your services are excellent.

### The Fix

A [website redesign](/services/website-redesign) with modern, clean aesthetics. Focus on simplicity, readable fonts, quality images, and plenty of breathing room.

## Sign #2: It's Not Mobile-Friendly

Pull out your phone right now and look at your website. Does it:

- **Require pinching and zooming** to read?
- **Have buttons too small** to tap accurately?
- **Cut off content** or show weird layouts?
- **Load slowly** over cellular data?

### Why It Matters

Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. In some industries, it's over 70%. If your site doesn't work on phones, you're turning away the majority of your potential customers.

Google also prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in search rankings. A non-responsive site literally ranks lower.

### The Fix

Mobile-first design. This means designing for phones first, then scaling up to desktop—not the other way around.

## Sign #3: Slow Loading Speed

Your website should load in under 3 seconds. If it takes longer, you're losing visitors.

### How to Check

Use Google's free [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) tool. Enter your URL and see your score.

- **90-100:** Excellent
- **50-89:** Needs improvement
- **0-49:** Poor (you're losing customers)

### Common Speed Killers

- **Unoptimized images** (the #1 culprit)
- **Too many plugins** on WordPress sites
- **Cheap hosting** with slow servers
- **Bloated code** from page builders
- **No caching** configured

### Why It Matters

Every second of load time costs you conversions:

- 1-second delay = 7% fewer conversions
- 40% of visitors abandon sites that take over 3 seconds
- Google ranks slow sites lower

### The Fix

[Speed optimization](/services/speed-technical-seo) including image compression, code cleanup, better hosting, and caching. Sometimes the site is too far gone and needs a rebuild with performance in mind from the start.

## Sign #4: You Can't Update It Yourself

Can you easily:

- Add a new service to your offerings?
- Update your hours or contact info?
- Post a new blog article?
- Change a photo?

If any of these require calling your "web guy" and waiting days (or paying a fee), your website isn't serving you—you're serving it.

### Common Problems

- **No content management system** (raw HTML files)
- **Overly complicated CMS** that's hard to navigate
- **Locked down by the developer** who controls everything
- **Broken editing tools** from years of neglect

### Why It Matters

A website that's hard to update doesn't get updated. Stale content signals to visitors (and Google) that your business might not be active.

### The Fix

A modern CMS with intuitive editing. We build sites where you can update text, images, and content without touching code.

## Sign #5: It's Not Generating Leads

This is the ultimate test. Is your website bringing in business?

### Warning Signs

- **No contact form submissions** in months
- **Phone calls mention** "I found you on Google" but website analytics show low traffic
- **High bounce rate**—people leave immediately after arriving
- **No clear calls-to-action** telling visitors what to do next

### Why It Matters

Your website isn't a brochure—it's a sales tool. If it's not generating leads, inquiries, or sales, it's failing at its job.

### The Fix

Conversion-focused redesign. This means:

- Clear value proposition above the fold
- Strategic calls-to-action throughout
- Trust signals (reviews, testimonials, credentials)
- Easy contact options (phone, form, chat)
- Fast load times so people don't leave

## The Cost of Waiting

Every day with a poor website costs you:

- **Lost customers** who chose competitors with better sites
- **Lower Google rankings** pushing you down in search results
- **Damaged credibility** with potential clients who do find you
- **Wasted marketing spend** driving traffic to a site that doesn't convert

A website redesign is an investment, but so is continuing to lose business to a site that doesn't work.
