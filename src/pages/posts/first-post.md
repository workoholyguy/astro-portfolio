### 1. Why I Chose Astro for My Portfolio

Astro hit all my criteria for a modern, performant site: minimal JavaScript, flexible components, and built-in content handling.

#### Zero-JS-by-Default:
By default, Astro renders pure HTML. Only where I explicitly opt in does JS load. This approach slashes bundle sizes and speeds up first paint dramatically.

#### Framework Agnosticism:

Need a React component here, a Svelte widget there? Astro’s “islands” model lets me mix and match without vendor lock-in or extra build steps.

#### Content First

With native support for Markdown, MDX, and automatic image optimization, I can author blog posts and docs without spinning up a separate CMS or plugin zoo.

### Key Lesson: 
Choose tools that enforce performance and flexibility by default. Astro does both.
