## Why Local SEO Matters for Georgia Businesses

When someone in Atlanta searches "plumber near me" or a Savannah resident looks up "best Italian restaurant," where does your business appear?

If the answer is "not on the first page," you're losing customers to competitors who've figured out local SEO.

This checklist will help you get found.

## Part 1: Google Business Profile (Essential)

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is the foundation of local SEO. This is what shows up in the "map pack"—those three businesses Google highlights for local searches.

### Setup Checklist

- [ ] **Claim your profile** at business.google.com
- [ ] **Verify ownership** (usually via postcard or phone)
- [ ] **Choose the right primary category** (be specific: "Family Dentist" beats "Dentist")
- [ ] **Add all secondary categories** that apply
- [ ] **Write a compelling description** with your main keywords
- [ ] **Add your service area** (counties/cities you serve)

### Optimization Checklist

- [ ] **Upload 10+ high-quality photos** (exterior, interior, team, products)
- [ ] **Add your logo** and cover photo
- [ ] **List all services** with descriptions
- [ ] **Set accurate business hours** (including holidays)
- [ ] **Enable messaging** if you can respond quickly
- [ ] **Add products** if applicable
- [ ] **Post weekly updates** (offers, news, events)

### Information Accuracy

- [ ] **NAP consistency** — Name, Address, Phone match everywhere online
- [ ] **Correct website URL** — Links to your actual site
- [ ] **Accurate service area** — Don't claim areas you don't serve

## Part 2: Website Local SEO

Your website needs to tell Google where you serve and what you do.

### Technical Foundations

- [ ] **Mobile-friendly design** — Test with Google's Mobile-Friendly Test
- [ ] **Fast loading speed** — Under 3 seconds (check with PageSpeed Insights)
- [ ] **SSL certificate** — Your URL should start with https://
- [ ] **Crawlable site structure** — Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

### On-Page Optimization

For each main page:

- [ ] **Title tag includes location** — "Plumbing Services in Atlanta, GA | Company Name"
- [ ] **Meta description mentions location** — 150-160 characters with city name
- [ ] **H1 heading with service + location** — "Emergency Plumbing Services in Atlanta"
- [ ] **Location mentioned naturally in content** — Don't stuff, but include it
- [ ] **Internal links** to service and location pages

### Location-Specific Pages

If you serve multiple cities, create dedicated pages:

- [ ] **Unique content per city** — Not duplicate content with city name swapped
- [ ] **Local landmarks/references** — Mention specific areas, neighborhoods
- [ ] **Local schema markup** — Structured data for each location
- [ ] **Embedded Google Map** for each area

For example, we have pages for [Atlanta](/locations/georgia/atlanta), [Marietta](/locations/georgia/marietta), [Alpharetta](/locations/georgia/alpharetta), and [other Georgia cities](/locations/georgia) we serve.

### Schema Markup

Add structured data to your site:

- [ ] **LocalBusiness schema** on your homepage
- [ ] **Service schema** on service pages
- [ ] **Review schema** if you display testimonials
- [ ] **FAQ schema** for frequently asked questions
- [ ] **Breadcrumb schema** for navigation

## Part 3: Citations and Directories

Citations are online mentions of your business NAP (Name, Address, Phone).

### Essential Directories (Free)

- [ ] Google Business Profile
- [ ] Bing Places
- [ ] Apple Maps Connect
- [ ] Facebook Business Page
- [ ] Yelp
- [ ] Better Business Bureau
- [ ] Yellow Pages
- [ ] Nextdoor Business

### Industry-Specific Directories

- [ ] **Healthcare:** Healthgrades, Zocdoc, Vitals
- [ ] **Legal:** Avvo, FindLaw, Justia
- [ ] **Home Services:** HomeAdvisor, Angi, Thumbtack
- [ ] **Restaurants:** TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Zomato
- [ ] **Real Estate:** Zillow, Realtor.com

### Georgia-Specific Directories

- [ ] Georgia Chamber of Commerce
- [ ] Atlanta Business Chronicle
- [ ] Local chamber of commerce (your city)
- [ ] Georgia Small Business Network
- [ ] Local news business directories

### Citation Consistency Rules

**CRITICAL:** Your NAP must be identical everywhere.

- Same business name (including "LLC" or "Inc." if you use it)
- Same address format (St. vs Street vs St)
- Same phone number format

Inconsistencies hurt your rankings.

## Part 4: Reviews Strategy

Reviews are a major ranking factor for local search.

### Getting Reviews

- [ ] **Ask satisfied customers** — Timing matters (ask after positive interaction)
- [ ] **Make it easy** — Send direct link to your Google review page
- [ ] **Add review links** to email signatures and receipts
- [ ] **Create a "Review Us" page** on your website
- [ ] **Use follow-up emails** after service completion

### Managing Reviews

- [ ] **Respond to ALL reviews** — Both positive and negative
- [ ] **Respond within 24-48 hours** — Shows you're attentive
- [ ] **Thank positive reviewers** — Be genuine, not generic
- [ ] **Address negative reviews professionally** — Don't argue, offer solutions
- [ ] **Never buy fake reviews** — Google penalizes this

### Review Goals

- **Quantity:** More reviews than competitors
- **Recency:** New reviews regularly (not all at once)
- **Quality:** 4.5+ star average
- **Keywords:** Reviews mentioning services naturally help rankings

## Part 5: Content for Local SEO

### Blog Content Ideas

- [ ] "[Service] in [City]: What You Need to Know"
- [ ] "Top 10 [Industry] Tips for [City] Residents"
- [ ] "How [City] Weather Affects Your [Product/Service]"

- [ ] "Customer Success Story: [Local Business/Client]"

### Local Link Building

- [ ] **Sponsor local events** — Often includes website link
- [ ] **Join local business associations** — Member directories
- [ ] **Partner with complementary businesses** — Cross-promotion
- [ ] **Get featured in local news** — Press releases for newsworthy events
- [ ] **Support local charities** — Many list sponsors

## Tracking Your Progress
