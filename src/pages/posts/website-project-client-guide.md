## Your First Website Project? Here's What Happens

Working with a web design agency for the first time can feel like a black box. You pay money, wait anxiously, and hope something good comes out.

It doesn't have to be that way. Here's what a professional website project actually looks like, step by step.

## Phase 1: Discovery and Planning

**What happens:** Before anyone touches design software, there's homework.

### The Discovery Call

You'll have a conversation (usually 30-60 minutes) covering:
- Your business and what you do
- Your customers and who you're trying to reach
- Your goals for the website
- Competitors and sites you like
- Timeline and budget
- Technical requirements

This isn't a sales pitch—it's information gathering. The agency needs to understand your business to build the right website.

### What You'll Provide

Be prepared to share:
- Your logo and brand colors (if you have them)
- Examples of websites you like (and don't like)
- Information about your services/products
- Photos of your work, team, or products
- Access to existing analytics if available
- Login credentials for current hosting/domain

### What You'll Receive

After discovery, you should get:
- A detailed proposal or scope document
- Price breakdown
- Estimated timeline
- Contract for review

**Typical duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Your involvement:** High (providing information)

## Phase 2: Design

**What happens:** The agency creates the visual design before writing any code.

### Wireframes (Sometimes)

Some agencies start with wireframes—rough layouts showing structure without visual design. These look like sketches or blueprints.

Purpose:
- Agree on page structure
- Plan content placement
- Identify missing elements early

### Design Mockups

Next come visual designs—usually for the homepage first, then key interior pages. These show exactly how the site will look, including:
- Colors and typography
- Image placement
- Button styles
- Navigation design
- Mobile layouts

### Your Role in Design

You'll review mockups and provide feedback. This is your time to:
- Point out anything you don't like
- Request changes to colors, fonts, or layout
- Confirm the direction is right
- Ask questions about anything unclear

**Be specific:** "I don't like the blue" isn't as helpful as "The blue feels too corporate; we're a friendly local business."

### Revision Rounds

Most contracts include 2-3 rounds of design revisions. This means:
- Round 1: Review initial design, provide feedback
- Round 2: Review revised design, provide final feedback
- Round 3: Minor tweaks only

Going beyond included revisions usually costs extra. Provide thorough feedback to stay on budget.

**Typical duration:** 2-4 weeks
**Your involvement:** Medium (reviewing and providing feedback)

## Phase 3: Development

**What happens:** Approved designs become a real, functioning website.

### What's Being Built

During development:
- Pages are coded
- Content management system (CMS) is set up
- Forms are configured
- Mobile responsiveness is implemented
- Basic SEO is added
- Speed optimization happens

### Staging Site

Most agencies provide a "staging site"—a private URL where you can see progress. You might check in weekly to:
- See development progress
- Test functionality
- Identify issues early
- Provide content feedback

### Content Integration

This is when your actual content goes in:
- Text copy
- Images and photos
- Service descriptions
- Team bios
- Any other content you've provided

**Important:** Content delays are the #1 cause of project delays. Have your content ready!

**Typical duration:** 2-4 weeks
**Your involvement:** Low to Medium (content delivery, periodic review)

## Phase 4: Review and Revisions

**What happens:** You thoroughly test the site and request final changes.

### What You're Testing

Check everything:
- All links work
- Forms submit correctly
- Pages load properly on mobile
- Content is accurate (no typos)
- Images display correctly
- Contact information is right
- Hours and location are accurate

### Providing Feedback

Be organized. A spreadsheet or document works well:

| Page | Issue | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| Homepage | Phone number wrong | High |
| About | Team photo is old | Medium |
| Contact | Form confirmation unclear | Low |

### What's Included vs Extra

Included in this phase:
- Fixing bugs (things that don't work)
- Correcting content you provided
- Minor tweaks within scope

Usually extra:
- Adding new pages
- Significant design changes
- Features not in original scope
- Content you didn't provide

**Typical duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Your involvement:** High (testing and providing feedback)

## Phase 5: Launch

**What happens:** The site goes live for the world to see.

### Pre-Launch Checklist

Before going live, professionals verify:
- All pages load correctly
- SSL certificate is active
- Forms send to correct recipients
- Analytics tracking is installed
- Sitemap is submitted to Google
- Backups are configured
- 301 redirects from old URLs (if redesign)

### The Actual Launch

Launch can happen different ways:
- **DNS switch:** Domain points to new site (can take 24-48 hours to propagate)
- **Server migration:** Files moved to live server
- **Same-server:** Staging folder becomes main site

You might experience brief downtime during launch—this is normal.

### Post-Launch

Immediately after launch:
- Check everything works on the live URL
- Share on social media
- Inform customers/clients
- Submit to Google Search Console

**Typical duration:** 1-3 days
**Your involvement:** Medium (final verification)

## Phase 6: Training and Handoff

**What happens:** You learn how to manage your new website.

### What You'll Learn

Training typically covers:
- Logging into the CMS
- Editing page content
- Adding new blog posts
- Updating images
- Managing forms
- Basic troubleshooting

### What You'll Receive

At handoff, you should get:
- Login credentials for everything
- Documentation or tutorial videos
- Source files if applicable
- List of tools/services used
- Emergency contact information

### Support Period

Most agencies include 30 days of free support post-launch to:
- Answer questions
- Fix bugs discovered after launch
- Provide additional training
- Make minor tweaks

**Typical duration:** Concurrent with launch
**Your involvement:** Medium (learning)

## Ongoing: Maintenance and Updates

**What happens:** After launch, your website needs ongoing care.

### What Maintenance Includes

Typical maintenance plans cover:
- Security updates
- Plugin/software updates
- Regular backups
- Uptime monitoring
- Minor content updates
- Technical support

### DIY vs Managed

You can:
1. **Manage yourself** — Update WordPress, make changes, handle issues
2. **Hire for maintenance** — Monthly retainer for ongoing support

Most businesses benefit from some level of managed maintenance—websites that aren't updated become security risks.

## Timeline Summary

For a typical small business website:

| Phase | Duration | Your Time |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Discovery | 1-2 weeks | 5-10 hours |
| Design | 2-4 weeks | 3-5 hours |
| Development | 2-4 weeks | 2-4 hours |
| Review | 1-2 weeks | 3-5 hours |
| Launch | 1-3 days | 2-3 hours |
| Training | 1-2 hours | 1-2 hours |
| **Total** | **6-12 weeks** | **15-30 hours** |

## How to Be a Great Client

Help your project succeed:

1. **Respond promptly** to requests and questions
2. **Provide content early** (don't wait until asked)
3. **Give specific feedback** (not just "I don't like it")
4. **Respect the scope** (new ideas = new costs)
5. **Trust the process** (we've done this before)
6. **Ask questions** (no such thing as stupid questions)
