## Choosing the Right Web Design Partner

Hiring a web design agency is a significant investment. Choose wrong, and you're stuck with a site that doesn't work, a partner who disappears, or a project that drags on forever.

Before you sign anything, ask these seven questions.

## Question #1: Can I See Examples of Similar Projects?

**Why it matters:** Every agency says they can build any type of website. But the best predictor of success is relevant experience.

**What to ask:**
- "Have you built websites for businesses like mine?"
- "Can you show me examples in my industry?"
- "What were the challenges with those projects?"

**Red flags:**
- No relevant examples in their portfolio
- Can't explain their work in detail
- Portfolio looks great but sites are actually slow or broken

**What to look for:**
- Projects similar to yours in scope and industry
- Sites that are still live and performing well
- Case studies with measurable results (traffic, leads, conversions)

## Question #2: What's Actually Included in the Price?

**Why it matters:** The headline price often excludes essentials. You need to know the total cost upfront.

**What to ask:**
- "What's included in this quote?"
- "What's NOT included?"
- "Are there ongoing costs after launch?"

**Get specifics on:**
- Number of pages
- Custom design vs templates
- Mobile responsiveness
- Content creation (copywriting, photos)
- SEO setup
- Form functionality
- Revisions allowed
- Training on how to update
- Post-launch support period

**Red flags:**
- Vague quotes without itemization
- "That would be extra" responses to basic features
- Unclear ongoing costs

**What to look for:**
- Detailed written proposal
- Clear scope document
- Transparent pricing breakdown

## Question #3: Who Actually Owns the Website When It's Done?

**Why it matters:** Some agencies retain ownership, holding your site hostage. You need to own what you pay for.

**What to ask:**
- "Will I own the website after it's paid for?"
- "Will I have access to all the files and code?"
- "Can I move it to a different host if I choose?"

**Red flags:**
- "You don't need the files, we'll host it for you"
- Proprietary platforms you can't export from
- Monthly fees required to keep the site online

**What to look for:**
- Clear ownership transfer upon final payment
- Access to all source files
- Ability to move hosting without agency permission
- No ongoing fees required just to keep your site live

## Question #4: What Happens if I Need Changes After Launch?

**Why it matters:** Websites need updates. You need to know how that works—and what it costs.

**What to ask:**
- "How do I make text and image updates myself?"
- "What if I need design changes later?"
- "Do you offer maintenance plans?"
- "What are your hourly rates for additional work?"

**Red flags:**
- You can't update anything yourself
- Changes require expensive hourly rates with no packages
- Agency is slow to respond after payment clears

**What to look for:**
- User-friendly content management system (CMS)
- Training on how to make basic updates
- Maintenance plan options at reasonable rates
- Documented hourly or project rates for future work

## Question #5: What's the Timeline and Process?

**Why it matters:** Projects without clear timelines drag on forever. You need milestones and accountability.

**What to ask:**
- "What's the expected timeline from start to launch?"
- "What's your process? What happens at each stage?"
- "What do you need from me, and when?"
- "What happens if there are delays?"

**Red flags:**
- No clear timeline ("It depends")
- No defined process or milestones
- History of projects taking much longer than quoted
- Blaming clients for all delays

**What to look for:**
- Written timeline with key milestones
- Clear deliverables at each stage
- Defined approval points
- Communication expectations spelled out

## Question #6: How Do You Handle SEO?

**Why it matters:** A beautiful website nobody can find is worthless. SEO should be built in, not bolted on.

**What to ask:**
- "What SEO work is included?"
- "Will the site be optimized for speed?"
- "How do you handle mobile optimization?"
- "Do you set up Google Analytics and Search Console?"

**Red flags:**
- "SEO is extra" for basic on-page optimization
- No mention of page speed or Core Web Vitals
- No structured data or schema markup
- No discussion of mobile-first approach

**What to look for:**
- On-page SEO included (titles, descriptions, headings)
- Speed optimization as standard
- Mobile-first design approach
- Analytics setup included
- Sitemap and robots.txt configured

## Question #7: What's Your Communication Style?

**Why it matters:** Poor communication ruins projects. You need a partner who's responsive and clear.

**What to ask:**
- "How will we communicate during the project?"
- "What's your typical response time?"
- "Who will be my main point of contact?"
- "How often will we have check-ins?"

**Red flags:**
- Already slow to respond during sales process
- No dedicated point of contact
- Vague answers about communication
- Dodgy about weekly/regular updates

**What to look for:**
- Clear communication channels established
- Reasonable response time commitments
- Named project manager or point of contact
- Regular scheduled updates

## Bonus: Questions They Should Ask YOU

A good agency wants to understand your business, not just take your money. Be wary if they don't ask:

- What's your business about?
- Who are your customers?
- What do you want the website to accomplish?
- Who are your competitors?
- What's your budget range?
- What's your timeline?
- Who will provide content?

An agency that builds without asking questions builds the wrong thing.

## Comparing Multiple Agencies

When you have quotes from several agencies, compare:

| Factor | Agency A | Agency B | Agency C |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Relevant experience | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| Clear scope document | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| Ownership clarity | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| Update ability | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| Timeline provided | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| SEO included | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| Communication quality | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ | ✓ / ✗ |
| Total cost (including extras) | $_____ | $_____ | $_____ |

Don't choose solely on price. The cheapest option often becomes the most expensive when things go wrong.

## Trust Your Gut

After asking these questions, pay attention to how you feel:
- Did they listen or just sell?
- Did they answer clearly or dodge?
- Do you feel confident or uncertain?
- Would you want to work with these people for weeks?

The working relationship matters. Choose a partner, not just a vendor.
