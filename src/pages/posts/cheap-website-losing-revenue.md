## The False Economy of Cheap Websites

You found a web designer on Fiverr who built your site for $500. Great deal, right?

Let's look at what that "deal" is actually costing you.

## The Math That Should Scare You

Say you run a service business in Georgia. Your average customer is worth $500 to $2,000. Now consider:

- Your website gets 500 visitors per month
- Industry average conversion rate is 2-5%
- A good website should convert 3% of visitors
- A poor website converts 0.5% or less

**With a good website:** 500 visitors × 3% = 15 leads per month
**With a cheap website:** 500 visitors × 0.5% = 2.5 leads per month

That's **12.5 lost leads every month**. At $1,000 average customer value:

**$12,500 in lost revenue. Every. Single. Month.**

Your $500 "savings" disappears in the first week.

## Why Cheap Websites Underperform

### Problem #1: They're Slow

Cheap hosting and unoptimized code mean slow load times. Every second costs you:

- 40% of visitors abandon sites that take over 3 seconds
- Each second of delay reduces conversions by 7%
- Google ranks slow sites lower, meaning less traffic

That $10/month hosting isn't saving money—it's costing leads.

### Problem #2: They Look Like Everyone Else

That $500 website is probably a template that thousands of other businesses use. When your competitor down the street has the same design, how do you stand out?

Trust is built through perceived professionalism. Generic designs signal generic business.

### Problem #3: No Mobile Optimization

Cheap developers often skip proper mobile testing. They check if it "kind of works" on their phone and call it done.

But "kind of works" isn't good enough when 60%+ of your visitors are on mobile devices. Buttons too small to tap, text impossible to read, forms that don't function—each issue drives customers away.

### Problem #4: Zero SEO Foundation

A cheap website typically has:

- No meta descriptions
- No structured data
- Poor URL structure
- Missing alt tags on images
- No sitemap
- Terrible page speed (which Google measures)

You're invisible to the people searching for your services.

### Problem #5: Security Vulnerabilities

That bargain WordPress installation probably has:

- Outdated plugins with known vulnerabilities
- No SSL certificate (or an expired one)
- Default admin credentials
- No backup system
- No security monitoring

When (not if) you get hacked, the cleanup costs more than doing it right the first time.

## Real Stories From Real Businesses

### The Dentist Who Couldn't Be Found

A dental practice in [Atlanta](/locations/georgia/atlanta) had a $800 website that looked "fine." Problem: It didn't rank for any local searches. Zero Google visibility.

After a proper [website redesign](/services/website-redesign) with SEO built in, they now rank on page one for "dentist near me" in their area. New patient inquiries doubled.

**Investment:** $4,500
**Return:** 5+ new patients monthly at $2,000+ average value

### The Contractor Missing Half His Calls

A general contractor's DIY site had a contact form that didn't work on mobile. He had no idea—nobody told him leads were bouncing.

When we fixed it (along with other issues), lead volume increased 180%.

### The Restaurant Nobody Could Find

A family restaurant's Wix site was so slow on mobile that Google barely showed it in local search. Competitors with faster sites got all the visibility.

Rebuilding on a proper platform with speed optimization put them back in the map pack. Reservations increased significantly.

## What Good Investment Looks Like

A professional website typically costs $2,500-$8,000. Here's the return:

**Month 1-3:** Website launches, SEO starts building
**Month 4-6:** Organic traffic increases, leads start flowing
**Month 7-12:** Compound effect—better rankings, more traffic, more leads
**Year 2+:** Website continues generating leads at no additional cost

Compare that to ads, where you pay for every click and leads stop when you stop paying.

## The Real Question

It's not "How much does a website cost?"

It's "How much business am I losing with my current website?"

A $5,000 website that generates $10,000/month in new business isn't an expense—it's a 200% monthly return on investment.

## Signs Your Cheap Website Is Failing

- **Bounce rate over 60%** — People leave immediately
- **Time on site under 1 minute** — They're not engaging
- **Form submissions near zero** — No one's reaching out
- **Mobile traffic but no mobile leads** — Phone experience is broken
- **You're embarrassed to share the URL** — Trust your instincts
