## "We Have a Facebook Page—Isn't That Enough?"

We hear this from restaurant owners across Georgia all the time. You've got a Facebook page, maybe an Instagram, you're on Yelp and Google. Why bother with a website?

Here's why that thinking is costing you customers.

## The Problem With Facebook-Only

### You Don't Control It

Facebook changes its algorithm constantly. Posts that reached thousands now reach hundreds. Pages that were prominent are now buried unless you pay for ads.

When you rely solely on Facebook:
- You're at the mercy of algorithm changes
- You can't control what information is most visible
- You can't customize the experience for potential diners
- Your competitor's ads can appear on YOUR page

### It Doesn't Help You Get Found

When someone searches "Italian restaurant Atlanta" or "brunch near Decatur," Facebook pages rarely show up in the top results. Google prioritizes:

1. Google Business Profile listings
2. Restaurant websites
3. Review sites like Yelp
4. Facebook (way down the list)

Without a website, you're invisible to Google search.

### It Looks Unprofessional

Right or wrong, potential diners judge restaurants by their online presence. A restaurant with only a Facebook page signals:

- "Too small to have a real website"
- "Not tech-savvy enough to keep up"
- "Maybe not around for long"

First impressions matter. Your digital presence is often the first impression.

## What a Restaurant Website Needs in 2025

### The Non-Negotiables

**1. Menu — Easy to Find and Mobile-Friendly**

Your menu should be:
- **Not a PDF** (hard to read on phones)
- **HTML text** that's searchable and accessible
- **Updated regularly** (seasonal changes, price updates)
- **One click from homepage**

**2. Hours and Location**

Prominent on every page:
- Today's hours (automatically highlighted)
- Full address with Google Maps
- Phone number (click-to-call on mobile)
- Parking information

**3. Online Reservations**

Integrate with:
- OpenTable
- Resy
- Yelp Reservations
- Your own booking system

If you don't take reservations, make sure that's clear too.

**4. Online Ordering** (if applicable)

For takeout and delivery:
- Direct ordering through your site (saves commission fees)
- Integration with Toast, Square, or other POS
- Clear pickup instructions

**5. Photos That Make People Hungry**

Professional food photography is worth every penny. Show:
- Signature dishes
- Interior ambiance
- Outdoor seating (if available)
- Kitchen action shots
- Real people enjoying meals

### The Should-Haves

**6. About/Story Page**

People connect with stories:
- Why you opened the restaurant
- Family history and traditions
- Chef background
- Community involvement

**7. Events and Specials**

Promote:
- Happy hour deals
- Live music nights
- Private dining options
- Seasonal menus
- Holiday specials

**8. Contact Form**

For:
- Catering inquiries
- Large party reservations
- Private event requests
- General questions

**9. Gift Cards**

Easy online purchase:
- Digital delivery
- Physical card shipping
- Customizable amounts

**10. Email Newsletter Signup**

Build your own audience:
- Announce new dishes
- Promote events
- Share exclusive offers
- Stay connected with regulars

## Facebook vs Website: The Numbers

| Metric | Facebook Page | Your Website |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Google search visibility | Low | High |
| Control over content | Limited | Complete |
| Customer data ownership | Facebook owns it | You own it |
| Conversion to reservations | Low (extra clicks) | High (direct booking) |
| Professional impression | Moderate | High |
| Mobile experience | Depends on Facebook | You control it |

## Real Impact: Georgia Restaurant Case Studies

### Midtown Atlanta Bistro

Before: Facebook and Instagram only. 50 reservations/month from digital sources.

After: Professional website with online booking. 200+ reservations/month from digital, plus direct ordering saving $2,000/month in third-party fees.

### Family-Owned Savannah Seafood

Before: Menu was a PDF nobody could read on phones. Phone rang constantly with "what are your hours?" questions.

After: Mobile-first website with clear hours and searchable menu. Call volume for basic questions dropped 60%. Staff can focus on service.

### Suburban Atlanta Sports Bar

Before: Relied on Facebook events for game day promotions. Engagement dropped 70% over two years due to algorithm changes.

After: Website with events calendar and email list. Built 3,000+ email subscribers who actually see promotions.

## "But I Don't Have Time to Maintain a Website"

Here's the thing: a well-built restaurant website doesn't need constant attention.

**Set it and (mostly) forget it:**
- Menu can update in minutes when needed
- Hours change for holidays in seconds
- Photos can be added anytime
- Events can be scheduled in advance

**What takes real time** (and you're already doing it):
- Taking great photos of food (use your phone)
- Updating specials (same effort as Facebook post)
- Responding to contact forms (less than phone calls)

A good website saves time by reducing repetitive phone calls and questions.

## The SEO Advantage for Georgia Restaurants

When your website is optimized for local search:

- "Italian restaurant Buckhead" → Your site can rank
- "Best brunch Decatur" → You appear in results
- "Restaurant with outdoor seating Atlanta" → Found by new customers

Facebook posts don't rank for these searches. Your website can.

Our [local SEO services](/services/local-seo) help Georgia restaurants get found by hungry customers searching online.

## What About Third-Party Delivery Apps?

DoorDash, UberEats, and Grubhub are necessary evils for many restaurants. But they:
- Take 15-30% of each order
- Own the customer relationship
- Control how you're displayed
- Compete you against everyone else

Your own website with direct ordering:
- Keeps 100% of the revenue
- Builds YOUR customer list
- Showcases YOUR brand
- Creates loyalty to YOU, not an app

Even if you use delivery apps, having direct ordering as an option saves money and builds relationships.
