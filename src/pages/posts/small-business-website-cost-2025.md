## The Real Cost of a Small Business Website

If you've been researching website costs, you've probably seen numbers ranging from $500 to $50,000. That's not helpful. Let's break down what a small business website actually costs in 2025 and what you get at each price point.

## Price Tiers Explained

### Budget Tier: $500 - $2,000

At this price point, you're typically looking at:

- **DIY website builders** (Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy)
- **Template-based WordPress sites** with minimal customization
- **Freelancers** just starting out

**What you get:** A basic online presence. 3-5 pages, contact form, maybe a blog.

**What you don't get:** Custom design, speed optimization, SEO setup, or ongoing support.

**Best for:** Side hustles, hobby businesses, or when you just need something online quickly.

### Mid-Range: $2,500 - $8,000

This is where most professional small business websites fall. You'll get:

- **Custom design** tailored to your brand (not just a template)
- **Mobile-responsive** layouts that work on all devices
- **Basic SEO setup** so Google can find you
- **Contact forms** that actually work
- **5-15 pages** depending on your needs
- **30-day support** after launch

**Best for:** Local businesses, service providers, healthcare practices, restaurants, and anyone who relies on their website for leads.

At [AVID TECH USA](/about), our [website design services](/services/website-design) fall in this range because we believe every small business deserves a professional online presence without enterprise-level pricing.

### Premium Tier: $10,000 - $25,000+

At this level, you're getting:

- **Full brand development** (logo, colors, typography)
- **Complex functionality** (booking systems, member portals, e-commerce)
- **Advanced SEO** and content strategy
- **Custom integrations** with your existing tools
- **Ongoing maintenance** plans

**Best for:** Established businesses ready to scale, companies with complex needs, or businesses in competitive markets.

## What Actually Affects the Price?

### 1. Number of Pages

More pages = more design work = higher cost. A simple 5-page site costs less than a 20-page site with multiple service categories.

### 2. Custom Design vs Templates

A custom design created specifically for your business costs more than modifying an existing template. But it also looks better and converts better.

### 3. Functionality Requirements

Need an online booking system? E-commerce? Member login area? Each feature adds complexity and cost.

### 4. Content Creation

Do you have your own photos and copy, or does the agency need to create them? Professional photography and copywriting add to the budget.

### 5. Timeline

Rush jobs cost more. A 2-week turnaround will be priced higher than a 6-week project.

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

Don't forget to budget for these ongoing expenses:

- **Domain name:** $10-50/year
- **Hosting:** $10-100/month depending on your needs
- **SSL certificate:** Often included with hosting, but sometimes $50-200/year
- **Maintenance:** $50-500/month for updates, backups, and security
- **Email:** $5-25/month per user for professional email

## What's the Best Value?

For most small businesses in Georgia, the sweet spot is $3,000-$6,000 for an initial website build. This gets you:

- Professional, custom design
- Fast-loading pages
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Basic SEO foundation
- Room to grow

Spending less often means redoing the site in 1-2 years. Spending more might not give you proportionally better results unless you have specific complex needs.

## Questions to Ask Before You Commit

Before signing with any web designer or agency, ask:

1. **What's included in the price?** Get a detailed breakdown.
2. **Who owns the website after it's built?** You should own it.
3. **What about ongoing costs?** Hosting, maintenance, updates.
4. **Can I see examples of similar projects?** Look for relevant experience.
5. **What's the timeline?** Get it in writing.
