## Protect Your Business From Bad Web Developers

For every legitimate web designer, there are several who'll take your money and deliver garbage—or nothing at all. Small businesses are prime targets because they often can't distinguish good from bad.

Here are the red flags to watch for and how to protect yourself.

## Red Flag #1: No Portfolio or Fake Examples

**The warning sign:**
- No portfolio on their website
- "We're working on case studies"
- Examples that look suspicious
- Can't provide references

**What scammers do:**
- Show other agencies' work as their own
- Use template screenshots they didn't actually build
- Display impressive sites that don't actually exist
- Hide behind stock photo mockups

**How to verify:**
- Ask for live URLs you can visit
- Check if the sites actually work on mobile
- Look up who actually built the site (often credited in footer)
- Request references you can actually call

**Legitimate agencies** have documented portfolios with verifiable work. [See our real projects here](/work).

## Red Flag #2: Prices That Are Too Good to Be True

**The warning sign:**
- Full custom website for $200-500
- "Limited time" pricing creating urgency
- Significantly cheaper than every other quote
- No clear explanation of what's included

**The reality:**
A professional custom website cannot be built for $500. At that price, you're getting:
- A template barely customized
- Work outsourced to low-quality offshore farms
- A scam where they take money and disappear
- A "website" you can't actually use or update

**What happens:**
- Site looks nothing like the mockup
- Filled with bugs and broken features
- No support after launch
- You end up paying to redo it correctly

**Fair pricing** for small business websites typically ranges from $2,500-$8,000 depending on complexity. [View transparent pricing examples](/pricing).

## Red Flag #3: Won't Provide a Written Contract

**The warning sign:**
- "We don't need a contract, we trust each other"
- Verbal agreements only
- Vague "proposals" with no specifics
- Resistance to putting terms in writing

**Why it matters:**
Without a contract, you have no recourse when:
- Scope changes aren't documented
- Timelines aren't met
- Deliverables don't match expectations
- They disappear with your deposit

**What you need in writing:**
- Exact scope of work
- Total price with payment schedule
- Timeline with milestones
- Revision policy
- Ownership terms
- Cancellation policy
- What's NOT included

A legitimate agency will **insist** on a contract to protect both parties.

## Red Flag #4: 100% Payment Upfront

**The warning sign:**
- Demand full payment before starting
- "We've been burned before, so we need everything upfront"
- No milestone payments

**The standard practice:**
- 25-50% deposit to start
- Additional payment at milestones
- Final payment upon completion
- Never 100% upfront

**Why it protects you:**
- Incentivizes the developer to finish
- Gives you leverage if things go wrong
- Allows you to cut losses if necessary
- Industry standard for good reason

## Red Flag #5: No Clear Process or Timeline

**The warning sign:**
- "We'll figure it out as we go"
- No estimated completion date
- No milestones or check-in points
- Vague about next steps

**What happens:**
- Project drags on indefinitely
- Constant scope creep
- No way to know if you're on track
- Excuses replace progress

**What professionals provide:**
- Clear phase breakdown
- Estimated timeline for each phase
- Regular update schedule
- Defined approval points

[See our defined process](/process) for what a professional workflow looks like.

## Red Flag #6: Communication Issues Early On

**The warning sign:**
- Slow to respond during sales process
- Vague answers to direct questions
- Poor grammar/communication in a native language
- Doesn't listen to what you actually need

**The truth:**
If communication is bad before you pay, it will be worse after. The sales process is when they're trying hardest to impress you.

**Warning behaviors:**
- Takes days to respond to emails
- Answers different questions than you asked
- Doesn't seem to understand your business
- Pushy or aggressive sales tactics

**What good communication looks like:**
- Responds within 24-48 hours (business days)
- Asks clarifying questions
- Explains things in terms you understand
- Seems genuinely interested in solving your problem

## Red Flag #7: Won't Share Previous Client References

**The warning sign:**
- "Our clients prefer privacy"
- "We can't share that information"
- Only provides testimonials (easily faked)
- Gets defensive when asked

**The reality:**
Happy clients are usually willing to provide references. Agencies with good track records want you to verify their work.

**What to do:**
- Ask for 2-3 references in similar industries
- Actually call them
- Ask about the experience, not just the result
- Inquire about problems and how they were resolved

## Red Flag #8: They Own Your Website

**The warning sign:**
- Site built on their proprietary system
- You don't get access to files
- Monthly "platform fees" required
- You can't move the site elsewhere

**The scam:**
Some developers build sites in ways that lock you in:
- Proprietary CMS you can't export from
- Hosting bundled at inflated prices
- No access to code or databases
- Site dies if you stop paying them

**What you should own:**
- All source code
- All design files
- Database access
- Ability to host anywhere
- No ongoing fees to maintain ownership

## Red Flag #9: No Physical Address or Verifiable Identity

**The warning sign:**
- No business address listed
- Can't find them on Google Maps
- No LinkedIn profiles for team members
- Company name brings up no results

**Why it matters:**
Legitimate businesses have verifiable identities. Scammers hide behind anonymity so they can disappear.

**How to verify:**
- Search their business name + "reviews"
- Look for BBB listing
- Check LinkedIn for real employees
- Verify the address on Google Maps
- Look for news mentions or community involvement

## Red Flag #10: Promises Guaranteed Rankings or Results

**The warning sign:**
- "We'll get you to #1 on Google"
- "Guaranteed 10x traffic"
- "Viral social media success"
- Any guarantee of specific outcomes

**The truth:**
No one can guarantee Google rankings. No one can promise specific traffic numbers. These are red flags for SEO scams specifically.

**What honest agencies say:**
- "We follow best practices"
- "Here are typical results from similar projects"
- "We'll optimize for search, but rankings depend on many factors"
- "We'll track progress and adjust strategy"

## How to Protect Yourself

### Before Hiring

1. **Get multiple quotes** (at least 3)
2. **Verify portfolios** (visit live sites)
3. **Check reviews** (Google, BBB, industry sites)
4. **Call references** (don't just read testimonials)
5. **Meet via video** (see who you're working with)

### During the Project

1. **Get everything in writing**
2. **Pay in milestones** (never 100% upfront)
3. **Keep copies** of all files shared
4. **Document communication** (email over verbal)
5. **Set regular check-ins** (weekly minimum)

### After Launch

1. **Get all files and access credentials**
2. **Test everything** before final payment
3. **Confirm you can update** the site yourself
4. **Know the support policy** for post-launch issues

## What to Do If You've Been Scammed

If you're already in a bad situation:

1. **Document everything** — Save all emails, contracts, payments
2. **Demand deliverables in writing** — Create a paper trail
3. **Dispute charges if applicable** — Credit cards have chargeback options
4. **Report to BBB and FTC** — Even if it doesn't help you, it helps others
5. **Leave honest reviews** — Warn other businesses
6. **Consult an attorney** — For significant amounts, legal action may be worthwhile
