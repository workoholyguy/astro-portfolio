## Why Your Healthcare Website Matters More Than Ever

Patients don't flip through Yellow Pages anymore. They search online, check reviews, and visit your website before ever picking up the phone.

If you're a healthcare provider in Georgia—whether you're a family practice, dental clinic, specialist office, or urgent care center—your website is often the first impression patients have of your practice.

Here's what it needs to include.

## Must-Have #1: Easy Online Appointment Booking

### Why It Matters

Patients want to book appointments at 10 PM after putting kids to bed. They want to schedule while on lunch break without making a phone call. If your website doesn't let them, your competitor's does.

### What You Need

- **Online scheduling system** that integrates with your practice management software
- **Real-time availability** (or next-available slots)
- **New patient forms** online to save time at arrival
- **Confirmation emails/texts** automatically sent

### Options

- SimplePractice (mental health)
- Zocdoc integration
- NexHealth
- Acuity Scheduling
- Direct EHR integration

## Must-Have #2: Mobile-Friendly Design

### The Stats

- 62% of healthcare searches happen on mobile devices
- 40% of patients have booked an appointment from their phone
- 70% will leave a website that doesn't work well on mobile

### What Mobile-Friendly Means

- **Fast loading** — Under 3 seconds
- **Tap-friendly buttons** — Large enough for fingers
- **Click-to-call phone number** — One tap to connect
- **Readable text** — No pinching or zooming
- **Easy navigation** — Simple menu that works on phones

If your current site requires zooming to read, you're losing patients.

## Must-Have #3: Provider Information With Photos

### Why It Matters

Healthcare is personal. Patients want to know who will be treating them before they arrive.

### What to Include

For each provider:
- **Professional headshot** (friendly, approachable)
- **Education and credentials**
- **Specialties**
- **Years of experience**
- **Brief bio** that shows personality
- **Languages spoken**

### Pro Tip

Avoid stock photos entirely. Patients notice, and it damages trust.

## Must-Have #4: Services Clearly Listed

### What Patients Need to Know

Before calling, patients want to confirm you offer what they need.

Create dedicated pages for each service with:
- **What the service involves**
- **Conditions treated**
- **What to expect** during the appointment
- **Insurance/payment information**
- **Link to book or call**

### For Dental Practices

- General dentistry
- Cosmetic procedures
- Emergency services
- Pediatric care
- Sedation options

### For Medical Practices

- Annual wellness exams
- Chronic disease management
- Acute care
- Preventive services
- Specialized treatments

## Must-Have #5: Location and Hours (Clearly Visible)

### Essential Information

- **Full address** with Google Maps embed
- **Office hours** including lunch closures
- **Holiday schedules** updated regularly
- **Parking information**
- **Public transit access** if applicable
- **Multiple locations** each with their own page

### Make It Findable

Don't bury this in the footer. Put it on every page header and create a dedicated "Contact/Location" page.

## Must-Have #6: Insurance Information

### What Patients Search For

"Does [your practice] accept Blue Cross Blue Shield?"
"Dentist in Atlanta that takes Medicaid"

### What to Include

- **List of accepted insurance plans** (update regularly!)
- **Process for out-of-network patients**
- **Self-pay pricing** or payment plan information
- **Financing options** if offered

### Important

If you don't list insurance information, patients assume you don't take theirs.

## Must-Have #7: Patient Reviews and Testimonials

### Why Reviews Matter

- 72% of patients use online reviews as first step to finding a doctor
- 84% trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations
- Patients read an average of 7 reviews before trusting a healthcare provider

### Where to Get Them

- Google Business Profile (most important)
- Healthgrades
- Zocdoc
- Vitals
- Your own website

### Display Them Prominently

Feature reviews on your homepage, not just a testimonials page nobody visits.

## Must-Have #8: HIPAA-Compliant Forms

### Requirements

If you collect patient information through your website (appointment requests, intake forms), you need:

- **SSL certificate** (https://)
- **HIPAA-compliant form handler**
- **Proper data encryption**
- **Business Associate Agreement** with form providers
- **Privacy policy** explaining data handling

### Don't Use Regular Contact Forms

Standard website contact forms are NOT HIPAA compliant. Use specialized healthcare form solutions.

## Must-Have #9: Accessibility Compliance

### Legal Requirements

Healthcare websites face higher scrutiny for ADA compliance. You need:

- **Alt text** on all images
- **Keyboard navigation** that works
- **Proper heading structure**
- **Color contrast** meeting WCAG guidelines
- **Readable font sizes**
- **Screen reader compatibility**

### Why It Matters Beyond Legal

15-20% of patients have some form of disability. Accessible websites serve everyone better.

## Must-Have #10: Local SEO Optimization

### Be Found When Patients Search

When someone searches "family doctor in Marietta" or "urgent care Alpharetta," will they find you?

### Essential Elements

- **Google Business Profile** fully optimized
- **Local keywords** in page titles and content
- **Location pages** for each office
- **Schema markup** for medical organizations
- **Citations** on healthcare directories

## Healthcare Website Red Flags

Avoid these common mistakes:

- **Outdated information** — Old providers listed, wrong hours
- **Stock photos of actors** — Patients notice
- **No online booking** — Losing to competitors who have it
- **Slow loading** — 40% abandon after 3 seconds
- **No reviews visible** — Seems like you have something to hide
- **Complicated navigation** — Patients give up

## The Patient Journey Online

1. **Search** — "dentist near me" or "pediatrician atlanta"
2. **Compare** — Check top 3-5 results, read reviews
3. **Visit website** — Look for credentials, services, insurance
4. **Make decision** — Can they book online? Is it easy?
5. **Book or call** — Or leave for a competitor's site

Your website needs to serve every step of this journey.
